## Pricing Plan
Versa AI has a simple pricing plan that is affordable for everyone! Trying the custom prompt is completely free! If you want a chat GPT-like format that is not specific to anything, then I recommend you try that out on the top navbar. For the 18 features listed above, the first 3000 credits are free. Credits are generated based on the content of the query and the response. Generally, a query and a response would take about roughly 100 - 500 credits. After the 3000 credits, users can sign up for a monthly plan of just $0.99. That's it! And in this plan, users can have unlimited credits! Email all cancellations to rohitvemuri@yahoo.com if you would like to cancel your plan.

## How I Came Up With the Idea
I wanted to build an application that allows users to interact with AI easier. I wanted there to be a structural view of features that connects to a user and what they need. I have always been fascinated with AI and how to use it effectively. Versa AI is a great platform to be able to use APIs to create a scalable product for a consumer. I wanted to use the latest and most innovative technology on the market in the space of AI. This application accepts actual payments, which a lot of projects do not do. I wanted this application to be actually usable and solve problems in the world today!
